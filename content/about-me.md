## Who am I? · 👨‍💻 🌈

Hi, my name is Jakub Błaszczyk (he/him), based in Warsaw, Poland.

## What I do? · ☕ 👨‍💻

Professionally, I am a Software Engineer specializing in Scala and Spark. I adhere to the engineering mindset of designing, building, and testing systems to meet functional requirements within practical constraints. I primarily work with Scala and Spark, valuing Scala for its strong static typing and support for both functional and object-oriented programming.

## What would I like to do? · 🔮 📝 🌴

I aim to work with Scala and Functional Programming. Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring, writing documentation, and earning certifications, such as my **Microsoft Azure Solution Architect Expert** and **Data Engineer Associate** exams. Equally important is the team culture. I prioritize a diverse, inclusive, and supportive environment where honesty and an "ok to fail" attitude prevail. I would choose a great team over a specific tech stack any day.

## How did I get where I am now? · ⚡ 🚀 🚊

I began my career as a full-stack developer in real estate before moving to JLL's Data Governance team. There, I learned the importance of data quality and stakeholder management. After seven years at JLL, I moved to investment banking. I worked at Credit Suisse in Data Governance and later at UBS as a Scala Engineer, helping build a Next Generation Archiving solution.

## What am I most proud of? · 🦚 🌌 🌈 🚀

In my professional life I am proud of:

*   ✅ Mastering functional programming concepts (thanks to Alvin Alexander and Daniel Ciocîrlan).
*   ✅ Working with supportive managers who helped me grow.
*   ✅ Volunteering in employee diversity networks at JLL, Credit Suisse, and UBS.
*   ✅ Earning **Microsoft Azure Solution Architect** and **Data Engineer** certifications.
*   ✅ The opportunity to learn something new every day.
